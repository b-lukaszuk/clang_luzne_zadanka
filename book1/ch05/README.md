# Chapter 5. Fruitful functions

## Task 1

Original exercise number: 5.1

Write a function named `IsTriangle()` that takes three integers as arguments and returns `TRUE` if you can build a triangle from the sides of that length or `FALSE` if you cannot do that.

Hint: if any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two then you cannot build a triangle. Otherwise, you can

# Usage example

## Compilation

gcc hello.c # compilation
./a.out # execution
